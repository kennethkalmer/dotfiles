# ~/.dotfiles

My attempt at bringing sanity and portability to my own dotfiles. Inspiration from several sources,
including but not limited to @holman, @sighmin, @kmckelvin, @gee\_for and others.

## Get started

If you need to, it should be fairly simple:

    $ git clone https://github.com/kennethkalmer/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    $ cd .dotfiles
    $ rake

This will symlink a bunch of stuff (everything ending in `.symlink`) into $HOME.

## Next up?

No idea
